I was born among the bodies. I was hurried
forward, and sealed a thin life for myself. 
I have shortened my name, and walk with
a limp. I place pebbles in milk and offer
them to my children when there is nothing
else. We can not live on cold blood alone. 
In a dream, I am ungendered, and the 2 moon
is just the moon having a thought of itself. 
I am a wolf masked in the scent of its prey
and I am driven—hawk like, to the dark
center of things. I have grasped my eager
heart in my own 5 talons. I am made of fire, 
and all fire passes through me. I am made
of smoke and all smoke passes through me. 
Now the bodies are just calcified gravity, 
built up and broken down over the years. 
Somewhere there are phantoms having their
own funerals over and over again. The same
scene for centuries. The same moon rolling
down the gutter of the same sky. Somewhere
they place a door at the beginning of a field
and call it property. Somewhere, a tired man
won’t let go of his dead wife’s hand. God
is a performing artist working only with
light and 40 stone. Death is just a child come to
take us by the hand, and lead us gently away. 
Fear is the paralyzing agent, the viper that
swallows us living and whole. And the devil, 
wears a crooked badge, multiplies everything
by three. You, my dark friend. And me.
